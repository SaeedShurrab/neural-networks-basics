# neural-networks-basics
This repository aims at providing simple illustration to the main concepts of neural networks.

mainly it consists of two parts, theoritical and practical parts. the theoritical part covers the main concepts of neural networks such as propagation,
gradient descent, derivation and many other concepts, while the practical part gives you a hands-on experience on coding nueral networks just using numpy libarary.

the original material of this repository is taken from Andrew Ng course of neural networks on coursera.
